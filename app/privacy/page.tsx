        <h1>WebBlog Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how A Medium Corporation (“Medium,” “we,”
          or “us”) collects, uses, and discloses information about you. This
          Privacy Policy applies when you use our websites, mobile applications,
          and other online products and services that link to this Privacy
          Policy (collectively, our “Services”), contact our customer service
          team, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make
          changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this
          policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice
          (such as adding a statement to our website or providing you with a
          notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy
          regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the
          choices available to you.
        </p>
        <h2>Information You Provide to Us</h2>
        <p>
          We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, you
          share information directly with us when you create an account, fill
          out a form, submit or post content through our Services, purchase a
          membership, communicate with us via third-party platforms, request
          customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of
          personal information we may collect include your name, display name,
          username, bio, email address, business information, your content,
          including your avatar image, photos, posts, responses, and series
          published by you, and any other information you choose to provide.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, we may also collect information you provide about
          others, such as when you purchase a Medium membership as a gift for
          someone. We will use this information to fulfill your request and will
          not send communications to your contacts unrelated to your request,
          unless they separately consent to receive communications from us or
          otherwise engage with us.
        </p>

        <p>
          We do not collect payment information through our Services. We rely on
          third parties to process payments in connection with our Services. Any
          information you provide to facilitate such a payment is subject to the
          third-party payment processor’s privacy policy, and we encourage you
          to review this policy before you provide any information to the
          payment processor.
        </p>
        <h2>Information We Collect from Other Sources</h2>
        <p>
          We obtain information from third-party sources. For example, we may
          collect information about you from social networks, accounting
          services providers and data analytics providers. Additionally, if you
          create or log into your Medium account through a third-party platform
          (such as Apple, Facebook, Google, or Twitter), we will have access to
          certain information from that platform, such as your name, lists of
          friends or followers, birthday, and profile picture, in accordance
          with the authorization procedures determined by such platform.
        </p>
        <h2>Information We Derive</h2>
        <p>
          We may derive information or draw inferences about you based on the
          information we collect. For example, we may make inferences about your
          location based on your IP address or infer reading preferences based
          on your reading history.
        </p>
        <h2>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h2>

        <p>
          We share personal information in the following circumstances or as
          otherwise described in this policy:
        </p>

        <p>
          We share personal information with other users of the Services. For
          example, if you use our Services to publish content, post comments or
          send private notes, certain information about you will be visible to
          others, such as your name, photo, bio, other account information you
          may provide, and information about your activities on our Services
          (e.g., your followers and who you follow, recent posts, claps,
          highlights, and responses).
        </p>
        <p>
          We share personal information with vendors, service providers, and
          consultants that need access to personal information in order to
          perform services for us, such as companies that assist us with web
          hosting, storage, and other infrastructure, analytics, payment
          processing, fraud prevention and security, customer service,
          communications, and marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may disclose personal information if we believe that disclosure is
          in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal
          process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet
          national security or law enforcement requirements. If we are going to
          disclose your personal information in response to legal process, we
          will give you notice so you can challenge it (for example by seeking
          court intervention), unless we are prohibited by law or believe doing
          so may endanger others or cause illegal conduct. We will object to
          legal requests for information about users of our Services that we
          believe are improper.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share personal information if we believe that your actions are
          inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, if we believe that
          you have violated the law, or if we believe it is necessary to protect
          the rights, property, and safety of Medium, our users, the public, or
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          We share personal information with our lawyers and other professional
          advisors where necessary to obtain advice or otherwise protect and
          manage our business interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share personal information in connection with, or during
          negotiations concerning, any merger, sale of company assets,
          financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by
          another company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal information is shared between and among Medium and our
          current and future parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries and other
          companies under common control and ownership.
        </p>
        <p>
          We share personal information with your consent or at your direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot
          reasonably be used to identify you.
